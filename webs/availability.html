        <p>In most of the countries, connectivity to iCloud Private Relay won't be a problem considering it's using http/2 as a fallback. </p>
        <p>However, according to Apple, regulatory reasons prevent the company from launching Private Relay in China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to enable it is to <a class="lnk" href="https://qust.me/post/PrivateRelay/">route Apple's iCloud API IP addresses through proxy</a>, while the actural iCPR won't go through proxy. By doing this Apple actually gives a IP address inside these countries, which can be found at <a class="lnk" href="https://mask-api.icloud.com/egress-ip-ranges.csv">https://mask-api.icloud.com/egress-ip-ranges.csv</a>, while the outbound data won't be censored as it goes through the CDN provider's internal network.</p>
